# follow-links
This is a python script that uses urllib and BeautifulSoup to receive input (url, count, position), follow each a tag at the given position a certain amount of times, and print the urls within each a tag.

This was written for the Coursera Assignment Following Links in HTML Using BeautifulSoup during Week 4.
